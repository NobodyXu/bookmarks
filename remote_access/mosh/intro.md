## Mosh

[mosh][1] is designed to be able to run on poor internet condition and provides robust and responsive connection.

It supports:
 - roaming to different IP without dropping connection
 - intermittent connectivity
 - intelligent local echo and line editing to reduce the effects of "network lag" on high-latency connections
