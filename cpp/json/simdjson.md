    > - Fast: Over 2.5x faster than commonly used production-grade JSON parsers.
    > - Record Breaking Features: Minify JSON at 6 GB/s, validate UTF-8 at 13 GB/s, NDJSON at 3.5 GB/s.
    > - Easy: First-class, easy to use and carefully documented APIs.
    > - Beyond DOM: Try the new On Demand API for twice the speed (>4GB/s).
    > - Strict: Full JSON and UTF-8 validation, lossless parsing. Performance with no compromises.
    > - Automatic: Selects a CPU-tailored parser at runtime. No configuration needed.
    > - Reliable: From memory allocation to error handling, simdjson's design avoids surprises.
    > - Peer Reviewed: Our research appears in venues like VLDB Journal, Software: Practice and Experience.
