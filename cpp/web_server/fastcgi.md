 1. [FastCGI-Archives/fcgi2](https://github.com/FastCGI-Archives/fcgi2)
    
    Open source, but required to preserve copy right notice.
    
    The API is similar to `stdio.h` (not modern API, but instead useful for migration from CGI) and writen in C.
 
 2. [eddic/fastcgipp](https://github.com/eddic/fastcgipp)
    
    GPL 3.0 licensed, C++ 11 code.
    
    I do not like the API and it also comes with a database support.

 3. [kristapsdz/kcgi](https://github.com/kristapsdz/kcgi)
    
    ISC license, provides a lot of C APIs.
