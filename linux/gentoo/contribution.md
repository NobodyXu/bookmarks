    TL;DR:
    
    > The goal of the GURU project is to create an official repository of new Gentoo packages that are maintained collaboratively by Gentoo users. It follows the tradition of Sunrise project but aims to improve its maintainability by reducing the involvement of Gentoo developers and letting experienced contributors take care of reviewing work of others.
