     - Provides more system checking on upgrading

 2. [Bedrock Linux](https://bedrocklinux.org/index.html)
    
    > Bedrock Linux is a meta Linux distribution which allows users to mix-and-match components from other, typically incompatible distributions.
    > Bedrock integrates these components into one largely cohesive system.
    > 
    > For example, one could have:
    > 
    >  - Debian's stable coreutils
    >  - Arch's cutting edge kernel
    >  - Void's runit init system
    >  - A pdf reader with custom patches automatically maintained by Gentoo's portage
    >  - A font from Arch's AUR
    >  - Games running against Ubuntu's libraries
    >  - Business software running against CentOS's libraries
    > All at the same time and working together mostly as though they were packaged for the same distribution.
